A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,
A London dandy safely classed
A birthday party, here a ball.
A bit of this a bit of that,
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
Absorbed by remorse at things done
Across the literary stack,
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
A distant strand of singing soars;
Admire it, as if he were trying.
A flow of silhouetted stills,
A full three hours at least he’d spend
Again, a simple touch amazes,
Again imagination blazes,
Again the pain, again love’s art!
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
A host of nymphs around her, so
Ah, they made me long despair
Alas, on every stray amusement
Albion’s proud lyre I follow,
All attentive, or just mumble!
All chained to their pre-conception,
All in our sage’s cell appears
All is still, only the guards
All life, before us, seemed so fair.
All mankind’s malicious ways
All night, barely a foot away!
All poets, it seems to me,
All serious effort – no words flow,
All’s tedium, madness, and pretence
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Always gave three balls a year
A mazurka holds the crowd;
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes.
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
And captive girls by the Salgira,
And carpeted voluptuousness.
And creditors had him at bay,
And daze the eyes of innocence,
And died with all he owed unmet.
And everything Parisian taste,
And, exiled for that very thing
And fail to offer a word, to make
And far niente is my law.
And for you, knowledgeable race,
And gladly lived a life of debt
And ignominiously repeat
And kept dull boredom far away –
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
And my Eugene was free at last,
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
And our Katenin moreover
And so in careless rapture I
And spirit finds creative fire.
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
And though a womaniser fine,
And though they’re filled with contradiction,
And to delight the sensual
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
And turning morning into night
And we can all display éclat,
And when he wanted to refer
And with southern oceans nigh
An instant hails the entrechat,
Another day I bring to mind!
A pedant in the details, no less.
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
A poem in cantos, twenty-five!
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Are enchanting, friends, I find!
Are you as you were? Have new
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
As ardent glances swiftly fly
As at the feast he seemed to be?
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
As emptiness possessed his soul,
As for finding ancient treasure
As his horses plough the dust,
As his watch’s chimes repeat
A single boat with outspread oars
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
As it is, I ask forgiveness,
Askance his opera-glass now centres
As some suspicious aged devil,
As though we can never treat
As well-read, but opinionated,
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
At that time, and retired from view,
Await the touch, involuntary,
A walk beside the lonely lake,
Before the mirror, then would leave
Before you, let him now advance.
Beneath the table’s damask gloss,
Benediction we drank deep!
Beseech, elicit true confession,
Beside some lines still incomplete.
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel,
Better to hurry to the ball,
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
Blue columns rising over folk,
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
Borne away to change at home.
Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,
Both had known the play of passion
Both had wearied of the game,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
But, God, what tedium to sample
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
But Petersburg that restless heap
But as for genius, if any,
But kept the juiciest stories ever
But later found it re-assuring,
But now my friends I often hear,
But our Onegin’s off to roam,
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
But still found nothing in his head,
But there’s a risk in such fiction,
But was dear Yevgeny content
But where, in what deserted strand
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
By the will of Zeus the Just.
Call to each other in the yards,
Cannot but despise it all,
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,
Careless of fame, the brittle.
Carried in dream to that land where
Catch the first flush of emotion,
Chapter One
China and bronzes fill the table,
‘Clear the road!’ loud sings the cry,
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
Content forever with their life,
Content with life, took a stance,
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
(Critics stern, acute as any)
Crunching over morning snow.
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
Dear liberty and leisure.
Deep in all things economic
Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly
Despite all efforts, or aspire
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,
Did I so long with painful ardour
Did all that was required to please.
Didelot too is quite the bore.’
Did full justice to the rest,
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
Down the streets where evening drowses,
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Each falling there as they form
Each man to his own ideas,
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
Enchantment fails such men as he,
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Enough of praise though for the proud,
Enters. The room is gyring,
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
Every dawn produces more
Exhausted by society,
Failed to join the shameless guild,
Faithlessness was not amusing
Falling ill like that, and dying;
Far from Italy’s allure.
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
Finding it small deprivation,
First Madame, you understand,
Float in a gondola’s embrace,
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,
For I stopped sinning long ago.
For all those years long sped by?
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
For conversation’s art created.
For idleness and sense to waste –
For rural silence, where the lyre
For teeth or nails, both are served,
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
For two days it was all quite new,
For whom among that jealous crowd,
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
Free, and in the flower of youth,
Freedom’s champion, ever strong
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
Friends and enemies from afar
Friends and friendship were confusing,
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
From Romulus to our own day,
From every pleasure he retreated,
From his uncle’s man, to say
From my words take warning due,
From the first, he’d spread confusion,
Frost’s silver powders on it lie.
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
Garbed to the modern taste,
Generally their conversation
Glad now that his former ways
Glass on glass to drench the heat
Glistening, an obedient tear!
God be thanked, some imitation,
Go, little book: find Neva then,
Great shelves of books he read and read
Guard your daughters most severely,
Had called to show their true devotion,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Happy is he who can employ
Has opened up his serving flap.
Hating all this litigation,
Heads, in profile, edges crop,
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
He breathes the air of freedom, at
He chose – a more than worthy goal,
He’d no desire to dig the dust
He drew a mourning veil of black.
He’d wander through a drawing room,
He even felt the urge to yawn,
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
He had the gift of easy chatter,
He knew enough I would allow
He lacked the passion and desire
He’ll have time still for the latter.
He notes the boxes, serried places,
He noticed nothing, did not care.
Here no conscience, there no sense,
Here without an ounce of bother,
Her way again in soulful flight?
He saunters on the Boulevard,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
He’s off to Talon’s, calculating
He wakes at noon, or even later,
He who feels, is quickly taught
He who had never once concealed
He who’s lived, he who’s thought
He with lawyers round his ears,
He would neglect and then abandon.
He yawned inordinately, and so
His beaver-collar shines away,
His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,
His epigrams topped up with bile.
His father had a fine career
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
His glance now bold, with tender art,
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
His heart consumed with regret
His labour, torment and delight,
His life till dawn the same as ever,
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
His springtime occupation bright,
His uncle lay at death’s door, better
His uncle’s frail mortality.
His unique eccentricity,
His virulence, his scorn, alight
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
How I envied the waves then,
How I longed to be those seas
How languid was his reticence,
How often, on a summer’s night,
How passionate his eloquence,
How poisonous the words he used!
How skilfully he’d feign the new,
How swift his letters from the heart!
How utterly himself forgetting!
I dare to write about it so,
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
I’d still wander those bright bowers.
I hear the magic of your voice!
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
I liked his face, his manner too,
I’ll breathe free, take my ease
I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.
I love their little feet, confess
I love youth’s frantic energy,
I made a friend of Eugene then.
I’m grieving still, but free of tears,
I might try to tell the whole tale,
I’m ready now for chapter two.
In both our hearts a dying flame,
In days of dream and ardour,
Indifferent to the world’s delight
In ease and innocence I take
In fact he soon received a letter
Ingenious London without cease
Ingenuous naivety,
In happiness, in idle ways,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
In his memory tucked away.
In human rights, was here all wrong.
In masculine attire displayed
In order to be heard more clearly.
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
In silent joy, of night’s bounteous
Insomnia, pale inspiration,
In the end he too grew bored
In the morning of our days.
In the springtime on the moss,
In the water’s smooth still glass,
Into society he rode.
In winter, resting on the fender,
I once spent my sweetest days?
I only wish the words I write
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
I read a lot, I doze a little,
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
I still remember, and it seems
Istomina stands, serious
I suffered without hope or joy.
I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
I too cast off the social burden,
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
It’s not my job to work them through.
It’s peppered with them to excess,
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
It’s time to leave this tedious shore,
It summons up respect, one can
I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,
I’ve sketched the underlying plan,
I’ve wasted far too many hours,
I was bitter, he was gloomy.
I was born for quiet existence
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
Land of bewitchment! In past times
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
Latin’s not in fashion now,
Leaning, musing pensively,
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Let us all follow his example!
Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
Like Venus if she’d condescend
Like a shadow, or a wife.
Liked his dreamy tendency,
Like prisoners released in sleep,
Like women, books proved a deception,
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
Lines more worthy of such themes,
Listen for the heart’s first cry,
Listen now to my sad voice.
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
Love in imagination,
Love’s madness, wild and unruly,
Madman, could your heart forget?
Mastered I’ve no time to tell,
Meanwhile in his morning dress
Meet my hero of romance,
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Might have been turned to better ends –
Monotonous and varied, say,
Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
More than once in white night-cap
Music’s magic, thought, and pain.
My country: exile was my lot,
My darkened mind grew clear again,
My disenchanted opera-glass,
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
My lips from hers will softly prove
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
My pen I find no longer wanders,
My rhyming novel’s well in hand,
My services to you I vow!
My songs inspired by that crowd.
My soul preserved its memory
My style is rendered quite absurd
‘My uncle, what a worthy man,
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
Nature’s debt already paid.
No Russian terms exist, confess,
No, for his early feelings faded,
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
No longer even stirred his will,
No need to keep reserves of gold.
No, never in the fiercest fires
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
No, passion took no greater toll,
No reason why a man of energy
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
Not for long were lovely ladies
Nothing touched his feelings there,
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
Now free, my verse no longer feared
Now our Eugene’s a countryman,
Now, when Eugene reached the age
O country life! I like you all,
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Of cosseting one who’s half alive;
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
Of history all turned to rust,
Of how it lives, the what and why
Of lovely woman, freakish fop.
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
Of over-elaborate slander try
Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,
Of someone other, never own
Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
Of tortured youth and its desires
Of your sublime clear poetry.
Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
On any fond face on this stage,
Once more resigned to being idle
One foot planted, pirouettes
Onegin and I planned to travel,
Onegin has outpaced us all.
Onegin, he was deemed by many
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
Onegin, to the theatre where
One thing alone he studied well,
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
On the granite parapet,
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
On what spring flowers are you set?
On what the state relies, he told,
Orchestra already tiring,
Or chondria, when we Russians speak,
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
Or else…..or else, may God forbid!
Or else, reviewing distantly,
Or end a letter with vale,
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are.
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
Or frighten with a glance or two
Or her breast, filled with languor;
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
Or the granite of the shore.
Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
Overcome with wit and passion,
Over the darkened stones instead,
Ozerov’s tragedies for years
Pampered in eastern luxury
Parading there with all the rest,
Past the doorman like an arrow,
Pay attention now I beg you,
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
Pleased as I always am to stress,
Pleased that they had done their duty.
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
Plus another hidden reason,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
Prince Vyazemsky
Produced his hive of comedy,
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
Recalling many a lost love there
Recalling romance of time past,
Recall the sea before a storm,
Reflecting you, your noble dreams,
Relinquished his inheritance,
Rewards with its fond caress
Roam beneath my African sky,
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
Rushes to live, and makes haste to feel.
И жить торопится и чувствовать спешит.
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
Sang the maid on mountain high,
Satire’s most audacious master,
Say farewell without delay.
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
Secure a secret assignation,
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
Seeking the pleasure of my friends
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
Sees it all; the fashions, faces,
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
Sentimental, free from care,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
Shall I depict with faithful pen
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
Silent, chattering, as you please,
Silently impart love’s teaching!
Silently to yawn and sigh
Since, I’m one too and just the same.
Since even he at times would sigh
Since, foretelling to my gaze
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
Sketching women’s legs and feet,
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
Soaring up the marble stair now,
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
So blameless in their intellect,
So clever, and so circumspect,
So he’ll double the intensity
So inflexible, so virtuous,
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
So, often, while he’s still abed,
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
So unapproachable, serene,
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
So youth’s happiness must pass,
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
Steel combs, files in various guises,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Such as they are, view these extremes
Such our young dog’s meditation,
Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.
Swims across the drowsy stream,
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
Taught him everything by whim,
Tells him, now is dinner-time.
Thank God no desire claimed him,
That I have here daubed my portrait,
That Onegin is not me, recall
That dressing room, all solitary,
That fashion or luxury supplies,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
That occupied each night and day,
That, search all Russia though,
That sitting by the bed all day,
That’s not the business we’ve in hand,
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
The Academic Dictionary.
The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.
The French cuisine’s finest proof,
The Muse gave it eternity,
The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,
The audience, their feet still tapping,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
The ballet’s beat he should be at.
The bitter record of the heart.
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
The careful spouse as much his man,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
The casual, the idealistic,
The cause of which it’s time to seek,
The censors must have work to do.
The child of luxury and delight.
The circle claps to make all happen,
The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,
The coachmen by the fire free
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
The coolness of the dark glades too,
The corpse on a table laid,
The country caused the same ennui
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
The dance-floor was my passion:
The dead man buried priest and guests
The fruit of carefree hours, unplanned,
The girls in fashionable dress,
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
The hero’s name I’ve given too;
The house was filled with commotion,
The intellect’s cold observation,
Their absent masters to berate.
Their dinner-table and their wife.
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
Their very presence causes spleen.
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
The light-footed girls sweep by,
The little foot I touch it seems;
The merchant and the beggar rise,
The milkmaids from Ochta go
Then Monsieur taught the child
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
The new ones simply antiquated,
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
Then he turns away – and yawns,
Then his father passed away,
Then later, intimacies meeting,
Then like a very sage could seem
Then off to ramble in the park.
Then what an epic I’ll contrive,
The object of his constancy;
The old ones utterly out-dated,
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
The pain of time lost, past recall:
The pineapple’s pure golden unguent.
(The place where we began, you see)
The punctilious German baker,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
There I too strolled to and fro:
There beside the Neva’s shore,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
The rustling curtain as we breathe
The safest place for a lover
The science of the tender passion
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
These varied chapters in your hand,
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
The sky aglow above the Neva,
The solitariness of the meadow,
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
The storm that shook my soul for years
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
The twin lights of the carriage throw
The useful arts, can devise,
The wealth of nations was his topic;
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;
They’re never worth the singer’s fire,
They yet can thrill me in my dreams.
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
This hostile climate where I wander,
This ruthless critic, legislator,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
Though I’m an adept at description,
Though I’ve consulted frequently
Though innocent tries one’s patience.
Though it adds to conversation,
Though it’s true some woman may
Though the North affects me so.
Though young he learnt the way to stir
Threads the rows among the feet,
Three houses offer a soirée:
Three notes appear, on a tray.
Through the hall, our hero’s there,
Tired of the laughter of the age,
To all unfaithful by and by,
To any but ourselves alone.
To blow his brains out, as we’re told,
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
Today we know, truth to tell
To dream affection constantly
To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:
To enter on the masquerade.
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
To give his life for poetry,
To his rivals, that whole set,
To his stand the cabman drives,
To journalists for their consumption
To kiss the young Armida’s lips,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
Too often by a foreign word,
To pair Yevgeny and I,
To pass a note of assignation.
To read an epigraph, and might
To roam the forests green, so us,
To tell iambic from trochee.
To the magic bow in thrall,
Touching lightly on each theme,
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Treading the boards interminably,
Tried to write, it makes him ill
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
Turning on the alien mass
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
Twists her waist one way, another,
Two slender feet…Now sad and cold
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
Unripe powers, or fading art,
Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
Was a very dandy in his dress,
Was he as vigorous and carefree
Was it for you all that distress?
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
Was once my sole preoccupation.
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
Were changing with the passing days.
Were ever dearest friends of his,
We’ve all acquired some education
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
‘What do I haunt the ballet for?
What more is needed? All agreed
What traps he set for those abused!
When all of Petersburg’s abed,
When inspired again, ecstatic,
When shall I ever loose my tether?
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
When talk was of some graver matter,
When will my wings begin to soar?
Where Italy’s gold nights descend,
Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,
Where fashion’s loyal devotee
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
Where my heart has long been smothered.
Where no face showed of Diana
Where will my young idler call?
Where you too were nourished or
Which to visit first? No matter,
While behind the window streams
While both indoors and outside
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
While drowned by frantic violins
While weary servants half-awake,
Who in your verse is your goddess?
‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
“Why the devil can’t you die?”’
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
With fond indulgence; witty, tragic,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
With some fair Venetian face,
With some ready epigram.
With staple products its supply,
With that pale diaphanous light,
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
With witticisms forged with guile,
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
Worn out by the ballroom’s noise
Would join the literary bores,
Yawning the while as he raced,
Yet Tasso’s murmured octaves are
Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
Yet his life grew sad and cold.
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.
Yet were they wholly innocent
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
You left no trace, but loved instead
You’ll not find three lovely pair.
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
You’re curious for every detail,
Your pure, pensive incantation?
Your question ringing in my ear,
Your spirit’s true simplicity
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
You were the first, capricious belles,

And so in careless rapture I
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
And captive girls by the Salgira,
Deep in all things economic
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
But still found nothing in his head,
Great shelves of books he read and read
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
No, for his early feelings faded,
He who had never once concealed
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
In the end he too grew bored
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
A London dandy safely classed
How poisonous the words he used!
For conversation’s art created.
From every pleasure he retreated,
As well-read, but opinionated,
For teeth or nails, both are served,
In masculine attire displayed
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
Nature’s debt already paid.
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
Failed to join the shameless guild,
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
My rhyming novel’s well in hand,
But where, in what deserted strand
First Madame, you understand,
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
Like Venus if she’d condescend
A full three hours at least he’d spend
Are enchanting, friends, I find!
Another day I bring to mind!
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
He saunters on the Boulevard,
My style is rendered quite absurd
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
Enough of praise though for the proud,
A mazurka holds the crowd;
For whom among that jealous crowd,
My songs inspired by that crowd.
As at the feast he seemed to be?
Float in a gondola’s embrace,
And for you, knowledgeable race,
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
Listen now to my sad voice.
I hear the magic of your voice!
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
Meet my hero of romance,
Content with life, took a stance,
Before you, let him now advance.
How languid was his reticence,
And daze the eyes of innocence,
All’s tedium, madness, and pretence
I was born for quiet existence
How passionate his eloquence,
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
Into society he rode.
Content forever with their life,
Like a shadow, or a wife.
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
Enchantment fails such men as he,
Frost’s silver powders on it lie.
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
A walk beside the lonely lake,
And fail to offer a word, to make
In ease and innocence I take
I might try to tell the whole tale,
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
China and bronzes fill the table,
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
All attentive, or just mumble!
His epigrams topped up with bile.
But, God, what tedium to sample
Let us all follow his example!
I read a lot, I doze a little,
Careless of fame, the brittle.
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Both had wearied of the game,
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
In both our hearts a dying flame,
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
Borne away to change at home.
All poets, it seems to me,
Chapter One
And though a womaniser fine,
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
Absorbed by remorse at things done
He noticed nothing, did not care.
Carried in dream to that land where
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
And spirit finds creative fire.
Despite all efforts, or aspire
He lacked the passion and desire
Didelot too is quite the bore.’
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
It’s time to leave this tedious shore,
Every dawn produces more
Far from Italy’s allure.
As for finding ancient treasure
Dear liberty and leisure.
For rural silence, where the lyre
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Ingenious London without cease
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
Did all that was required to please.
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
I’ll breathe free, take my ease
Here no conscience, there no sense,
Beside some lines still incomplete.
I only wish the words I write
And everything Parisian taste,
Garbed to the modern taste,
For idleness and sense to waste –
From my words take warning due,
Before the mirror, then would leave
His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,
A poem in cantos, twenty-five!
My lips from hers will softly prove
I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
And, exiled for that very thing
A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
But later found it re-assuring,
Enters. The room is gyring,
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
Friends and friendship were confusing,
Faithlessness was not amusing
He’s off to Talon’s, calculating
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
How utterly himself forgetting!
Falling ill like that, and dying;
Admire it, as if he were trying.
Freedom’s champion, ever strong
In human rights, was here all wrong.
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
And with southern oceans nigh
It’s not my job to work them through.
Free, and in the flower of youth,
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
He drew a mourning veil of black.
Across the literary stack,
Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,
Blue columns rising over folk,
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
He chose – a more than worthy goal,
And to delight the sensual
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel,
As some suspicious aged devil,
A birthday party, here a ball.
Better to hurry to the ball,
Cannot but despise it all,
Mastered I’ve no time to tell,
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
As emptiness possessed his soul,
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
But our Onegin’s off to roam,
Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
He’d wander through a drawing room,
Each falling there as they form
It summons up respect, one can
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
I’ve sketched the underlying plan,
‘My uncle, what a worthy man,
I too cast off the social burden,
Go, little book: find Neva then,
I made a friend of Eugene then.
How I envied the waves then,
I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
My darkened mind grew clear again,
Music’s magic, thought, and pain.
Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,
He would neglect and then abandon.
Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
Both had known the play of passion
Beseech, elicit true confession,
From the first, he’d spread confusion,
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
Hating all this litigation,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
Love in imagination,
Insomnia, pale inspiration,
Generally their conversation
God be thanked, some imitation,
Finding it small deprivation,
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
And though they’re filled with contradiction,
But there’s a risk in such fiction,
I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,
Catch the first flush of emotion,
Had called to show their true devotion,
Like women, books proved a deception,
All chained to their pre-conception,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
He even felt the urge to yawn,
For I stopped sinning long ago.
I liked his face, his manner too,
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
He yawned inordinately, and so
A host of nymphs around her, so
I dare to write about it so,
I’m ready now for chapter two.
More than once in white night-cap
But Petersburg that restless heap
Has opened up his serving flap.
Benediction we drank deep!
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
Like prisoners released in sleep,
Heads, in profile, edges crop,
But now my friends I often hear,
Glistening, an obedient tear!
Always gave three balls a year
Friends and enemies from afar
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
In winter, resting on the fender,
His father had a fine career
And when he wanted to refer
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
Here without an ounce of bother,
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
He wakes at noon, or even later,
He had the gift of easy chatter,
He’ll have time still for the latter.
His uncle lay at death’s door, better
In fact he soon received a letter
His life till dawn the same as ever,
But kept the juiciest stories ever
And our Katenin moreover
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,
All life, before us, seemed so fair.
Ah, they made me long despair
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
In days of dream and ardour,
Did I so long with painful ardour
Each man to his own ideas,
How I longed to be those seas
Might have been turned to better ends –
All is still, only the guards
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Call to each other in the yards,
He notes the boxes, serried places,
Lines more worthy of such themes,
Land of bewitchment! In past times
And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes.
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
Askance his opera-glass now centres
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Down the streets where evening drowses,
Again imagination blazes,
Again, a simple touch amazes,
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
A flow of silhouetted stills,
I still remember, and it seems
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
All in our sage’s cell appears
He with lawyers round his ears,
I’m grieving still, but free of tears,
A single boat with outspread oars
A distant strand of singing soars;
My pen I find no longer wanders,
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
I’d still wander those bright bowers.
I’ve wasted far too many hours,
My disenchanted opera-glass,
In the water’s smooth still glass,
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
It’s peppered with them to excess,
I love their little feet, confess
No Russian terms exist, confess,
A pedant in the details, no less.
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
As it is, I ask forgiveness,
And carpeted voluptuousness.
Meanwhile in his morning dress
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
Beneath the table’s damask gloss,
In the springtime on the moss,
In silent joy, of night’s bounteous
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
Istomina stands, serious
In the morning of our days.
I once spent my sweetest days?
In happiness, in idle ways,
Glad now that his former ways
All mankind’s malicious ways
Glass on glass to drench the heat
As his watch’s chimes repeat
And ignominiously repeat
As though we can never treat
An instant hails the entrechat,
A bit of this a bit of that,
And we can all display éclat,
He breathes the air of freedom, at
And gladly lived a life of debt
Madman, could your heart forget?
And died with all he owed unmet.
Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,
His heart consumed with regret
His virulence, his scorn, alight
His labour, torment and delight,
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Indifferent to the world’s delight
Her way again in soulful flight?
And turning morning into night
How often, on a summer’s night,
His springtime occupation bright,
He who feels, is quickly taught
He who’s lived, he who’s thought
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Alas, on every stray amusement
But was dear Yevgeny content
My country: exile was my lot,
How swift his letters from the heart!
His glance now bold, with tender art,
Again the pain, again love’s art!
And my Eugene was free at last,
Did full justice to the rest,
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
By the will of Zeus the Just.
He’d no desire to dig the dust
As his horses plough the dust,
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
And far niente is my law.
At that time, and retired from view,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
How skilfully he’d feign the new,
For two days it was all quite new,
Are you as you were? Have new
All serious effort – no words flow,
He knew enough I would allow
Albion’s proud lyre I follow,
Latin’s not in fashion now,
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Crunching over morning snow.
My services to you I vow!
And creditors had him at bay,
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
From Romulus to our own day,
Monotonous and varied, say,
From his uncle’s man, to say
In his memory tucked away.
And kept dull boredom far away –
His beaver-collar shines away,
All night, barely a foot away!
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
For all those years long sped by?
Liked his dreamy tendency,
I love youth’s frantic energy,
Guard your daughters most severely,
Leaning, musing pensively,
Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly
As ardent glances swiftly fly
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
In order to be heard more clearly.
Love’s madness, wild and unruly,
I was bitter, he was gloomy.
But as for genius, if any,
(Critics stern, acute as any)
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
I suffered without hope or joy.
Happy is he who can employ
Await the touch, involuntary,
‘Clear the road!’ loud sings the cry,
Listen for the heart’s first cry,
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
My soul preserved its memory
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
Exhausted by society,
Ingenuous naivety,
His unique eccentricity,
His uncle’s frail mortality.
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
To pair Yevgeny and I,
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
Where no face showed of Diana
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
The sky aglow above the Neva,
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
With fond indulgence; witty, tragic,
The wealth of nations was his topic;
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
When inspired again, ecstatic,
The casual, the idealistic,
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
You left no trace, but loved instead
Over the darkened stones instead,
So, often, while he’s still abed,
When all of Petersburg’s abed,
Yawning the while as he raced,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
What more is needed? All agreed
The fruit of carefree hours, unplanned,
Now free, my verse no longer feared
Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,
Where my heart has long been smothered.
What traps he set for those abused!
The old ones utterly out-dated,
The new ones simply antiquated,
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
The corpse on a table laid,
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
Or else…..or else, may God forbid!
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
Then Monsieur taught the child
Yet his life grew sad and cold.
Two slender feet…Now sad and cold
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
No need to keep reserves of gold.
On what the state relies, he told,
To blow his brains out, as we’re told,
That’s not the business we’ve in hand,
These varied chapters in your hand,
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
Where Italy’s gold nights descend,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
Too often by a foreign word,
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice
Relinquished his inheritance,
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Now, when Eugene reached the age
On any fond face on this stage,
Or end a letter with vale,
Once more resigned to being idle
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are.
Recalling many a lost love there
Nothing touched his feelings there,
Onegin, to the theatre where
Or the granite of the shore.
Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
Of cosseting one who’s half alive;
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
И жить торопится и чувствовать спешит.
With some fair Venetian face,
Though innocent tries one’s patience.
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
To enter on the masquerade.
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
While both indoors and outside
To tell iambic from trochee.
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
Was he as vigorous and carefree
The coachmen by the fire free
(The place where we began, you see)
Where fashion’s loyal devotee
Their dinner-table and their wife.
Tired of the laughter of the age,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
The rustling curtain as we breathe
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
“Why the devil can’t you die?”’
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
While weary servants half-awake,
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
With witticisms forged with guile,
Translated the sublime Corneille,
To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:
Since, I’m one too and just the same.
Touching lightly on each theme,
Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime
Tells him, now is dinner-time.
So unapproachable, serene,
To any but ourselves alone.
Sentimental, free from care,
Yet Tasso’s murmured octaves are
Through the hall, our hero’s there,
They’re never worth the singer’s fire,
Three houses offer a soirée:
There beside the Neva’s shore,
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
Silent, chattering, as you please,
Worn out by the ballroom’s noise
The merchant and the beggar rise,
The useful arts, can devise,
Their absent masters to berate.
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
Then what an epic I’ll contrive,
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
Since, foretelling to my gaze
The French cuisine’s finest proof,
Silently impart love’s teaching!
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
The audience, their feet still tapping,
Orchestra already tiring,
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
Then later, intimacies meeting,
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
Sang the maid on mountain high,
Since even he at times would sigh
Silently to yawn and sigh
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
That, search all Russia though,
The country caused the same ennui
Or chondria, when we Russians speak,
Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek
The cause of which it’s time to seek,
Then off to ramble in the park.
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
Rushes to live, and makes haste to feel.
Onegin and I planned to travel,
You’re curious for every detail,
That Onegin is not me, recall
The pain of time lost, past recall:
Where will my young idler call?
To the magic bow in thrall,
Onegin has outpaced us all.
O country life! I like you all,
Today we know, truth to tell
One thing alone he studied well,
Tried to write, it makes him ill
No longer even stirred his will,
No, passion took no greater toll,
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
Swims across the drowsy stream,
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
With some ready epigram.
Then like a very sage could seem
Thank God no desire claimed him,
Taught him everything by whim,
Recall the sea before a storm,
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
The careful spouse as much his man,
Now our Eugene’s a countryman,
Their very presence causes spleen.
Shall I depict with faithful pen
The circle claps to make all happen,
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
Overcome with wit and passion,
The science of the tender passion
Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,
The dance-floor was my passion:
We’ve all acquired some education
To pass a note of assignation.
Secure a secret assignation,
Was once my sole preoccupation.
‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,
Though it adds to conversation,
Such our young dog’s meditation,
Your pure, pensive incantation?
The intellect’s cold observation,
The house was filled with commotion,
Though I’m an adept at description,
To journalists for their consumption
Plus another hidden reason,
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
Of someone other, never own
The censors must have work to do.
The milkmaids from Ochta go
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
The hero’s name I’ve given too;
The coolness of the dark glades too,
There I too strolled to and fro:
Though the North affects me so.
Or frighten with a glance or two
Of lovely woman, freakish fop.
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Your question ringing in my ear,
Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.
When will my wings begin to soar?
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
This hostile climate where I wander,
The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,
When shall I ever loose my tether?
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
Twists her waist one way, another,
The punctilious German baker,
‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
Satire’s most audacious master,
Which to visit first? No matter,
When talk was of some graver matter,
The safest place for a lover
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
You’ll not find three lovely pair.
Though young he learnt the way to stir
Where you too were nourished or
‘What do I haunt the ballet for?
Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,
This ruthless critic, legislator,
The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
Or her breast, filled with languor;
Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
Seeking the pleasure of my friends
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
Sees it all; the fashions, faces,
Not for long were lovely ladies
That fashion or luxury supplies,
You were the first, capricious belles,
Such as they are, view these extremes
No, never in the fiercest fires
Of tortured youth and its desires
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Would join the literary bores,
Steel combs, files in various guises,
One foot planted, pirouettes
To his stand the cabman drives,
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;
Were ever dearest friends of his,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
Reflecting you, your noble dreams,
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
They yet can thrill me in my dreams.
While behind the window streams
The little foot I touch it seems;
While drowned by frantic violins
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
Then he turns away – and yawns,
To kiss the young Armida’s lips,
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
The storm that shook my soul for years
Ozerov’s tragedies for years
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
Turning on the alien mass
So youth’s happiness must pass,
Who in your verse is your goddess?
Rewards with its fond caress
The girls in fashionable dress,
Was a very dandy in his dress,
Was it for you all that distress?
Pleased as I always am to stress,
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
The dead man buried priest and guests
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
To roam the forests green, so us,
So inflexible, so virtuous,
Were changing with the passing days.
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
The ballet’s beat he should be at.
Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
So blameless in their intellect,
So clever, and so circumspect,
Sketching women’s legs and feet,
Threads the rows among the feet,
Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
On the granite parapet,
To his rivals, that whole set,
On what spring flowers are you set?
The child of luxury and delight.
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
With that pale diaphanous light,
To read an epigraph, and might
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
That I have here daubed my portrait,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
Yet were they wholly innocent
The pineapple’s pure golden unguent.
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
The bitter record of the heart.
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Unripe powers, or fading art,
Recalling romance of time past,
Parading there with all the rest,
Of history all turned to rust,
Pay attention now I beg you,
The solitariness of the meadow,
Soaring up the marble stair now,
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
The twin lights of the carriage throw
Past the doorman like an arrow,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
That occupied each night and day,
That sitting by the bed all day,
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
There Didelot too crowned his day,
Say farewell without delay.
Though it’s true some woman may
Three notes appear, on a tray.
Then his father passed away,
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
To all unfaithful by and by,
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
The light-footed girls sweep by,
The object of his constancy;
Produced his hive of comedy,
No reason why a man of energy
Of how it lives, the what and why
Prince Vyazemsky
Roam beneath my African sky,
Treading the boards interminably,
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
With staple products its supply,
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
Or else, reviewing distantly,
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
To dream affection constantly
Though I’ve consulted frequently
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
Onegin, he was deemed by many
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
The Academic Dictionary.
That dressing room, all solitary,
Of your sublime clear poetry.
To give his life for poetry,
Of over-elaborate slander try
Pampered in eastern luxury
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
Your spirit’s true simplicity
The Muse gave it eternity,
So he’ll double the intensity
Pleased that they had done their duty.

--------------------------------------------------


Indifferent to the world’s delight

Seeking the pleasure of my friends

I only wish the words I write

Might have been turned to better ends –

Reflecting you, your noble dreams,

Your spirit’s true simplicity

Lines more worthy of such themes,

Of your sublime clear poetry.

Such as they are, view these extremes

These varied chapters in your hand,

With fond indulgence; witty, tragic,

The casual, the idealistic,

The fruit of carefree hours, unplanned,

Insomnia, pale inspiration,

Unripe powers, or fading art,

The intellect’s cold observation,

The bitter record of the heart.

Chapter One
И жить торопится и чувствовать спешит.

Rushes to live, and makes haste to feel.

Prince Vyazemsky
1.
‘My uncle, what a worthy man,

Falling ill like that, and dying;

It summons up respect, one can

Admire it, as if he were trying.

Let us all follow his example!

But, God, what tedium to sample

That sitting by the bed all day,

All night, barely a foot away!

And the hypocrisy, demeaning,

Of cosseting one who’s half alive;

Puffing the pillows, you contrive

To bring his medicine unsmiling,

Thinking with a mournful sigh,

“Why the devil can’t you die?”’

2.
Such our young dog’s meditation,

As his horses plough the dust,

Inheriting, as sole relation,

By the will of Zeus the Just.

Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,

Here without an ounce of bother,

Meet my hero of romance,

Before you, let him now advance.

Eugene Onegin, born and raised

There beside the Neva’s shore,

Where you too were nourished or

Found your fame, perhaps amazed,

There I too strolled to and fro:

Though the North affects me so.

3.
His father had a fine career

And gladly lived a life of debt

Always gave three balls a year

And died with all he owed unmet.

But Fate took Eugene by the hand

First Madame, you understand,

Then Monsieur taught the child

A pleasant-natured lad but wild.

Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,

Spared the lad from weary lessons,

Ducked the moralizing sermons,

Taught him everything by whim,

A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,

Then off to ramble in the park.

4.
Now, when Eugene reached the age

Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,

Those years of hope and tender rage,

Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,

And my Eugene was free at last,

A London dandy safely classed

His hair cut neatly a la mode,

Into society he rode.

French he spoke and wrote with ease,

Danced the mazurka deftly too,

Bowed to each acquaintance new,

Did all that was required to please.

What more is needed? All agreed

That here was wit and charm indeed.

5.
We’ve all acquired some education

A bit of this a bit of that,

God be thanked, some imitation,

And we can all display éclat,

Onegin, he was deemed by many

(Critics stern, acute as any)

As well-read, but opinionated,

For conversation’s art created.

He had the gift of easy chatter,

Touching lightly on each theme,

Then like a very sage could seem

When talk was of some graver matter,

Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam

With some ready epigram.

6.
Latin’s not in fashion now,

Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,

He knew enough I would allow

To read an epigraph, and might

Mention Juvenal by the way,

Or end a letter with vale,

And knew by heart, or thought he did,

Two whole lines of the Aeneid.

As for finding ancient treasure

He’d no desire to dig the dust

Of history all turned to rust,

But kept the juiciest stories ever

From Romulus to our own day,

In his memory tucked away.

7.
He lacked the passion and desire

To give his life for poetry,

Despite all efforts, or aspire

To tell iambic from trochee.

Bored by Theocritus and Homer,

Adam Smith was more his tome, where

Deep in all things economic

The wealth of nations was his topic;

On what the state relies, he told,

Of how it lives, the what and why

With staple products its supply,

No need to keep reserves of gold.

Left his father, stunned by theory,

Of mortgaging his land quite weary.

8.
The wealth of things my Yevgeny

Mastered I’ve no time to tell,

But as for genius, if any,

One thing alone he studied well,

His springtime occupation bright,

His labour, torment and delight,

That occupied each night and day,

And kept dull boredom far away –

The science of the tender passion

The one poor Ovid used to sing,

And, exiled for that very thing

Plus another hidden reason,

Ended on the Black Sea shore,

Far from Italy’s allure.

9/10.
From the first, he’d spread confusion,

Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,

Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,

Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,

Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,

All attentive, or just mumble!

How languid was his reticence,

How passionate his eloquence,

How swift his letters from the heart!

Breathing one thing, loving one thing,

How utterly himself forgetting!

His glance now bold, with tender art,

Roguish, coy, or see appear,

Glistening, an obedient tear!

11.
How skilfully he’d feign the new,

And daze the eyes of innocence,

Or frighten with a glance or two

Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,

Catch the first flush of emotion,

Overcome with wit and passion,

Ingenuous naivety,

Await the touch, involuntary,

Beseech, elicit true confession,

Listen for the heart’s first cry,

Pursue love wholly, and thereby

Secure a secret assignation,

Then later, intimacies meeting,

Silently impart love’s teaching!

12.
Though young he learnt the way to stir

The heart of a confirmed coquette!

And when he wanted to refer

To his rivals, that whole set,

How poisonous the words he used!

What traps he set for those abused!

But you, the men in wedded bliss,

Were ever dearest friends of his,

The careful spouse as much his man,

Betrayed, a husband from a novel,

As some suspicious aged devil,

Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan

Content forever with their life,

Their dinner-table and their wife.

13-15.
So, often, while he’s still abed,

Three notes appear, on a tray.

What? Invitations? Swiftly read,

Three houses offer a soirée:

A birthday party, here a ball.

Where will my young idler call?

Which to visit first? No matter,

He’ll have time still for the latter.

Meanwhile in his morning dress

Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,

He saunters on the Boulevard,

Parading there with all the rest,

Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime

Tells him, now is dinner-time.

16.
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:

‘Clear the road!’ loud sings the cry,

His beaver-collar shines away,

Frost’s silver powders on it lie.

He’s off to Talon’s, calculating

His friend Kaverin will be waiting.

He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!

The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.

A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,

And truffles, luxuries of youth,

The French cuisine’s finest proof,

And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;

Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,

The pineapple’s pure golden unguent.

17.
Glass on glass to drench the heat

Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,

As his watch’s chimes repeat

The ballet’s beat he should be at.

This ruthless critic, legislator,

The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,

To all unfaithful by and by,

Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly

Onegin, to the theatre where

He breathes the air of freedom, at

An instant hails the entrechat,

Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,

Or shouts for his Moina, merely

In order to be heard more clearly.

18.
Land of bewitchment! In past times

Satire’s most audacious master,

Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,

And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes.

Ozerov’s tragedies for years

Won tributes of spontaneous tears,

Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,

And our Katenin moreover

Translated the sublime Corneille,

Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,

Produced his hive of comedy,

There Didelot too crowned his day,

Where, in the shadow of the wings,

My youth fled by, enchantment clings.

19.
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?

Listen now to my sad voice.

Are you as you were? Have new

Idols replaced you, a worse choice?

Do I hear once more your choir sing?

See a Russian Terpsichore wing

Her way again in soulful flight?

Or must my dull gaze fail to light

On any fond face on this stage,

Turning on the alien mass

My disenchanted opera-glass,

Tired of the laughter of the age,

Silently to yawn and sigh

For all those years long sped by?

20.
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,

The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,

The circle claps to make all happen,

The rustling curtain as we breathe

Soars, glistening half-ethereal,

To the magic bow in thrall,

A host of nymphs around her, so

Istomina stands, serious

One foot planted, pirouettes

Takes a leap and, like down, sets

Off as if blown by Aeolus,

Twists her waist one way, another,

Spins, beats one foot on the other.

21.
Vast applause. Onegin enters,

Threads the rows among the feet,

Askance his opera-glass now centres

On unknown faces, ranked, complete.

He notes the boxes, serried places,

Sees it all; the fashions, faces,

Fill him with dissatisfaction,

Bows to friends, then views the action,

Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,

Within its glow no interest dawns,

Then he turns away – and yawns,

‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;

‘What do I haunt the ballet for?

Didelot too is quite the bore.’

22.
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,

Treading the boards interminably,

While weary servants half-awake,

Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,

The audience, their feet still tapping,

Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.

While both indoors and outside

Lanterns glitter far and wide,

The carriage horses, chilly, wait,

Their harness chafing, restlessly,

The coachmen by the fire free

Their absent masters to berate.

But our Onegin’s off to roam,

Borne away to change at home.

23.
That dressing room, all solitary,

Shall I depict with faithful pen

Where fashion’s loyal devotee

Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?

All that, to sate boundless caprice,

Ingenious London without cease

Sends us through the Baltic trade,

For timber and tallow, quickly paid,

And everything Parisian taste,

The useful arts, can devise,

That fashion or luxury supplies,

For idleness and sense to waste –

All in our sage’s cell appears

Our philosopher of eighteen years.

24.
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,

China and bronzes fill the table,

And to delight the sensual

Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;

Steel combs, files in various guises,

Brushes of thirty different sizes,

For teeth or nails, both are served,

Scissors with straight blades and curved.

Rousseau (I mention it by the way)

Could not conceive how haughty Grimm

Dared clean his nails in front of him,

Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!

Freedom’s champion, ever strong

In human rights, was here all wrong.

25.
No reason why a man of energy

Should disregard the subject of his nails;

Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?

Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.

A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,

Fearing all the barbs of envy,

Was a very dandy in his dress,

A pedant in the details, no less.

A full three hours at least he’d spend

Before the mirror, then would leave

His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,

Like Venus if she’d condescend

In masculine attire displayed

To enter on the masquerade.

26.
Garbed to the modern taste,

You’re curious for every detail,

And for you, knowledgeable race,

I might try to tell the whole tale,

But there’s a risk in such fiction,

Though I’m an adept at description,

No Russian terms exist, confess,

For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;

As it is, I ask forgiveness,

My style is rendered quite absurd

Too often by a foreign word,

It’s peppered with them to excess,

Though I’ve consulted frequently

The Academic Dictionary.

27.
That’s not the business we’ve in hand,

Better to hurry to the ball,

Since with a cab hired from the stand,

Onegin has outpaced us all.

Along the rows of darkened houses,

Down the streets where evening drowses,

The twin lights of the carriage throw

A rainbow glitter on the snow.

Oil-lamps bright on window sills,

The sumptuous mansion gleams,

While behind the window streams

A flow of silhouetted stills,

Heads, in profile, edges crop,

Of lovely woman, freakish fop.

28.
Past the doorman like an arrow,

Through the hall, our hero’s there,

Soaring up the marble stair now,

With a hand he smoothes his hair,

Enters. The room is gyring,

Orchestra already tiring,

A mazurka holds the crowd;

The crush intense, the noise is loud.

A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,

The light-footed girls sweep by,

As ardent glances swiftly fly

In pursuit, the dancers mingling;

While drowned by frantic violins

The jealous ladies whisper sins.

29.
In days of dream and ardour,

The dance-floor was my passion:

The safest place for a lover

To pass a note of assignation.

Oh you, esteemed husbands, now

My services to you I vow!

Pay attention now I beg you,

From my words take warning due,

You mothers, hear me too, I bid,

Guard your daughters most severely,

Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,

Or else…..or else, may God forbid!

I dare to write about it so,

For I stopped sinning long ago.

30.
Alas, on every stray amusement

I’ve wasted far too many hours,

Yet were they wholly innocent

I’d still wander those bright bowers.

I love youth’s frantic energy,

The crush, the lights, the gaiety,

The girls in fashionable dress,

I love their little feet, confess

That, search all Russia though,

You’ll not find three lovely pair.

Ah, they made me long despair

Two slender feet…Now sad and cold

I still remember, and it seems

They yet can thrill me in my dreams.

31.
But where, in what deserted strand

Madman, could your heart forget?

Ah, little feet where do you stand?
On what spring flowers are you set?

Pampered in eastern luxury

On our northern snows, so gloomy,

You left no trace, but loved instead

The sensual touch, on rugs to tread

And carpeted voluptuousness.

The call of fame, praise, I forgot,

My country: exile was my lot,

Was it for you all that distress?

So youth’s happiness must pass,

Brief as your footprints on the grass.

32.
Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,

Are enchanting, friends, I find!

Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek

Far more enchanting, to my mind.

Since, foretelling to my gaze

Pleasure in a thousand ways,

Its subtle beauty lights the fires

Of a swarm of sweet desires.

Such I adore, my dear Elvina,

Beneath the table’s damask gloss,

In the springtime on the moss,

In winter, resting on the fender,

Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,

Or the granite of the shore.

33.
Recall the sea before a storm,

How I envied the waves then,

Each falling there as they form

To lie at her feet, in peace again!

How I longed to be those seas

Kissing her dear feet as they please!

No, never in the fiercest fires

Of tortured youth and its desires

Did I so long with painful ardour

To kiss the young Armida’s lips,

The roses of her burning cheeks,

Or her breast, filled with languor;

No, passion took no greater toll,

Nor ever so consumed my soul!

34.
Another day I bring to mind!

Sometimes in my fondest dreams

I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,

The little foot I touch it seems;

Again imagination blazes,

Again, a simple touch amazes,

Stirs blood inside my weary heart,

Again the pain, again love’s art!

Enough of praise though for the proud,

Enough of my loquacious lyre,

They’re never worth the singer’s fire,

My songs inspired by that crowd.

Their words, their looks, both are sweet,

Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.

35.
And my Onegin? Half-asleep

He flees the ball, and finds his bed,

But Petersburg that restless heap

Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.

The merchant and the beggar rise,

To his stand the cabman drives,

The milkmaids from Ochta go

Crunching over morning snow.

The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,

Shutters part, chimneys smoke,

Blue columns rising over folk,

The punctilious German baker,

More than once in white night-cap

Has opened up his serving flap.

36.
Worn out by the ballroom’s noise

And turning morning into night

Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy

The child of luxury and delight.

He wakes at noon, or even later,

His life till dawn the same as ever,

Monotonous and varied, say,

Tomorrow just like yesterday.

But was dear Yevgeny content

Free, and in the flower of youth,

Midst glittering victories, in truth,

Midst oft repeated amusement?

Was he as vigorous and carefree

As at the feast he seemed to be?

37.
No, for his early feelings faded,

Exhausted by society,

Not for long were lovely ladies

The object of his constancy;

Faithlessness was not amusing

Friends and friendship were confusing,

Since even he at times would sigh

At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie

Endless bottles of sparkling wine

And fail to offer a word, to make

A bon mot, with a fierce headache,

And though a womaniser fine,

In the end he too grew bored

With duelling, pistols, and the sword.

38.
The sickness, with which he was smitten,

The cause of which it’s time to seek,

That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)

Or chondria, when we Russians speak,

Had gradually overwhelmed him,

Thank God no desire claimed him,

To blow his brains out, as we’re told,

Yet his life grew sad and cold.

Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,

He’d wander through a drawing room,

No gossip could dispel his gloom,

Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,

Nothing touched his feelings there,

He noticed nothing, did not care.

39-42.
You were the first, capricious belles,

He would neglect and then abandon.

Today we know, truth to tell

The crushing boredom of bon ton.

Though it’s true some woman may

Talk of Bentham and of Say,

Generally their conversation

Though innocent tries one’s patience.

Besides they are so pure, so pious,

So clever, and so circumspect,

So blameless in their intellect,

So inflexible, so virtuous,

So unapproachable, serene,

Their very presence causes spleen.

43.
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,

When all of Petersburg’s abed,

The speeding cabs whirl out of sight

Over the darkened stones instead,

You too Yevgeny quite deserted.

From every pleasure he retreated,

Onegin, shut himself indoors,

Would join the literary bores,

Tried to write, it makes him ill

All serious effort – no words flow,

He yawned inordinately, and so

Failed to join the shameless guild,

Of Writers: whom I cannot blame

Since, I’m one too and just the same.

44.
As emptiness possessed his soul,

Once more resigned to being idle

He chose – a more than worthy goal,

The thoughts of other men to rifle;

Great shelves of books he read and read

But still found nothing in his head,

All’s tedium, madness, and pretence

Here no conscience, there no sense,

All chained to their pre-conception,

The old ones utterly out-dated,

The new ones simply antiquated,

Like women, books proved a deception,

Across the literary stack,

He drew a mourning veil of black.

45.
I too cast off the social burden,

At that time, and retired from view,

I made a friend of Eugene then.

I liked his face, his manner too,

Liked his dreamy tendency,

His unique eccentricity,

His mind, incisive, and chilly;

I was bitter, he was gloomy.

Both had known the play of passion

Both had wearied of the game,

In both our hearts a dying flame,

Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,

All mankind’s malicious ways

In the morning of our days.

46.
He who’s lived, he who’s thought

Cannot but despise it all,

He who feels, is quickly taught

The pain of time lost, past recall:

Enchantment fails such men as he,

Bitten by the snake, Memory,

Absorbed by remorse at things done

Though it adds to conversation,

Lends it charm, intense delight.

I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing

But later found it re-assuring,

His virulence, his scorn, alight

With witticisms forged with guile,

His epigrams topped up with bile.

47.
How often, on a summer’s night,

The sky aglow above the Neva,

With that pale diaphanous light,

Where no face showed of Diana

In the water’s smooth still glass,

Recalling romance of time past,

Recalling many a lost love there

Sentimental, free from care,

In silent joy, of night’s bounteous

Benediction we drank deep!

Like prisoners released in sleep,

To roam the forests green, so us,

Carried in dream to that land where

All life, before us, seemed so fair.

48.
His heart consumed with regret

Leaning, musing pensively,

On the granite parapet,

As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.

All is still, only the guards

Call to each other in the yards,

Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet

The cobbles of Milyona Street.

A single boat with outspread oars

Swims across the drowsy stream,

A horn rings out, enchanted dream,

A distant strand of singing soars;

Yet Tasso’s murmured octaves are

Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.

49.
Waves of the distant Adriatic,

Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice

When inspired again, ecstatic,

I hear the magic of your voice!

Sacred to scions of Apollo,

Albion’s proud lyre I follow,

To know its beauty, be its friend.

Where Italy’s gold nights descend,

I’ll breathe free, take my ease

Float in a gondola’s embrace,

With some fair Venetian face,

Silent, chattering, as you please,

My lips from hers will softly prove

The tongue of Petrarch and of love.

50.
When shall I ever loose my tether?

Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,

I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,

Signal each passing sail, each shroud.

When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free

To fight the waves, and scour the sea,

When will my wings begin to soar?

It’s time to leave this tedious shore,

This hostile climate where I wander,

And with southern oceans nigh

Roam beneath my African sky,

To mourn there for gloomy Russia,

Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,

Where my heart has long been smothered.

51.
Onegin and I planned to travel,

To feast our eyes on foreign lands,

But soon we saw our plans unravel,

Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.

Then his father passed away,

And creditors had him at bay,

Each man to his own ideas,

He with lawyers round his ears,

Hating all this litigation,

Content with life, took a stance,

Relinquished his inheritance,

Finding it small deprivation,

Or else, reviewing distantly,

His uncle’s frail mortality.

52.
In fact he soon received a letter

From his uncle’s man, to say

His uncle lay at death’s door, better

Say farewell without delay.

Yevgeny read the gloomy note,

Then grasped the instant by the throat,

Took to the road, went post-haste,

Yawning the while as he raced,

Prepared, for the sake of gold,

For boredom, and hypocrisy,

(The place where we began, you see)

Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,

The corpse on a table laid,

Nature’s debt already paid.

53.
The house was filled with commotion,

Friends and enemies from afar

Had called to show their true devotion,

Or enjoy the funeral, as you are.

The dead man buried priest and guests

Did full justice to the rest,

Ate, drank, then left, solemnly

Pleased that they had done their duty.

Now our Eugene’s a countryman,

With vineyard, water, wood, and field,

He who had never once concealed

His wastefulness and lack of plan.

Glad now that his former ways

Were changing with the passing days.

54.
For two days it was all quite new,

The solitariness of the meadow,

The coolness of the dark glades too,

The babbling brook, the silent furrow,

By the third, field, wood, and hill,

No longer even stirred his will,

He even felt the urge to yawn,

He saw as clear as the dawn,

The country caused the same ennui

Despite the lack of streets and yards,

Of dances, poetry, and cards,

While disillusion dogged him constantly,

Pursued him endlessly through life,

Like a shadow, or a wife.

55.
I was born for quiet existence

For rural silence, where the lyre

Sounds more sweetly in the silence,

And spirit finds creative fire.

In ease and innocence I take

A walk beside the lonely lake,

And far niente is my law.

Every dawn produces more

Dear liberty and leisure.

I read a lot, I doze a little,

Careless of fame, the brittle.

Was it not, with such pure pleasure,

In happiness, in idle ways,

I once spent my sweetest days?

56.
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,

O country life! I like you all,

Pleased as I always am to stress,

That Onegin is not me, recall

It, lest some sly, caustic reader,

Some tell-tale, or vile inventor

Of over-elaborate slander try

To pair Yevgeny and I,

And ignominiously repeat

That I have here daubed my portrait,

Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,

As though we can never treat

Of someone other, never own

To any but ourselves alone.

57.
All poets, it seems to me,

Love in imagination,

To dream affection constantly

Was once my sole preoccupation.

My soul preserved its memory

The Muse gave it eternity,

And so in careless rapture I

Sang the maid on mountain high,

And captive girls by the Salgira,

But now my friends I often hear,

Your question ringing in my ear,

‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?

For whom among that jealous crowd,

Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?

58.
‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,

Rewards with its fond caress

Your pure, pensive incantation?

Who in your verse is your goddess?

No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!

Love’s madness, wild and unruly,

I suffered without hope or joy.

Happy is he who can employ

Fevered rhyme on such a theme

So he’ll double the intensity

Of the sacred flames of poesy,

Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem

To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:

But I was mute, foolish in the game.

59.
Love faded then the Muse appeared,

My darkened mind grew clear again,

Now free, my verse no longer feared

Music’s magic, thought, and pain.

I write, my heart no longer suffers,

My pen I find no longer wanders,

Sketching women’s legs and feet,

Beside some lines still incomplete.

The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,

I’m grieving still, but free of tears,

The storm that shook my soul for years

Soon, soon my mind will not remember:

Then what an epic I’ll contrive,

A poem in cantos, twenty-five!

60.
I’ve sketched the underlying plan,

The hero’s name I’ve given too;

My rhyming novel’s well in hand,

I’m ready now for chapter two.

I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,

And though they’re filled with contradiction,

It’s not my job to work them through.

The censors must have work to do.

To journalists for their consumption

I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.

Go, little book: find Neva then,

My newborn work, my sweet creation,

Earn me the first fruits of fame,

Noise, incomprehension, blame!
