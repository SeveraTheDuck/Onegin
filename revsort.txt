To pair Yevgeny and I,
And so in careless rapture I
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
Where no face showed of Diana
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
And captive girls by the Salgira,
The sky aglow above the Neva,
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
With fond indulgence; witty, tragic,
Deep in all things economic
The wealth of nations was his topic;
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
When inspired again, ecstatic,
The casual, the idealistic,
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
But still found nothing in his head,
Great shelves of books he read and read
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
You left no trace, but loved instead
Over the darkened stones instead,
So, often, while he’s still abed,
When all of Petersburg’s abed,
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
Yawning the while as he raced,
No, for his early feelings faded,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
What more is needed? All agreed
He who had never once concealed
The fruit of carefree hours, unplanned,
Now free, my verse no longer feared
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,
Where my heart has long been smothered.
In the end he too grew bored
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
A London dandy safely classed
What traps he set for those abused!
How poisonous the words he used!
The old ones utterly out-dated,
For conversation’s art created.
From every pleasure he retreated,
As well-read, but opinionated,
The new ones simply antiquated,
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
For teeth or nails, both are served,
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
In masculine attire displayed
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
The corpse on a table laid,
Nature’s debt already paid.
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
Or else…..or else, may God forbid!
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
Then Monsieur taught the child
Failed to join the shameless guild,
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
Yet his life grew sad and cold.
Two slender feet…Now sad and cold
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
No need to keep reserves of gold.
On what the state relies, he told,
To blow his brains out, as we’re told,
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
That’s not the business we’ve in hand,
My rhyming novel’s well in hand,
These varied chapters in your hand,
But where, in what deserted strand
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
First Madame, you understand,
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
Like Venus if she’d condescend
Where Italy’s gold nights descend,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
A full three hours at least he’d spend
Are enchanting, friends, I find!
Another day I bring to mind!
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
He saunters on the Boulevard,
Too often by a foreign word,
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
My style is rendered quite absurd
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
Enough of praise though for the proud,
A mazurka holds the crowd;
For whom among that jealous crowd,
My songs inspired by that crowd.
As at the feast he seemed to be?
Float in a gondola’s embrace,
And for you, knowledgeable race,
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice
Listen now to my sad voice.
I hear the magic of your voice!
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
Meet my hero of romance,
Relinquished his inheritance,
Content with life, took a stance,
Before you, let him now advance.
How languid was his reticence,
And daze the eyes of innocence,
All’s tedium, madness, and pretence
I was born for quiet existence
How passionate his eloquence,
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
Into society he rode.
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Content forever with their life,
Like a shadow, or a wife.
Now, when Eugene reached the age
On any fond face on this stage,
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
Enchantment fails such men as he,
Frost’s silver powders on it lie.
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
A walk beside the lonely lake,
And fail to offer a word, to make
In ease and innocence I take
I might try to tell the whole tale,
Or end a letter with vale,
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
China and bronzes fill the table,
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
All attentive, or just mumble!
Once more resigned to being idle
His epigrams topped up with bile.
But, God, what tedium to sample
Let us all follow his example!
I read a lot, I doze a little,
Careless of fame, the brittle.
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Both had wearied of the game,
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
In both our hearts a dying flame,
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
Borne away to change at home.
All poets, it seems to me,
Chapter One
And though a womaniser fine,
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
Absorbed by remorse at things done
He noticed nothing, did not care.
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are.
Recalling many a lost love there
Nothing touched his feelings there,
Carried in dream to that land where
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
Onegin, to the theatre where
And spirit finds creative fire.
Despite all efforts, or aspire
He lacked the passion and desire
Didelot too is quite the bore.’
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
Or the granite of the shore.
It’s time to leave this tedious shore,
Every dawn produces more
Far from Italy’s allure.
As for finding ancient treasure
Dear liberty and leisure.
For rural silence, where the lyre
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Ingenious London without cease
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
Did all that was required to please.
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
I’ll breathe free, take my ease
Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,
Here no conscience, there no sense,
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
Beside some lines still incomplete.
I only wish the words I write
And everything Parisian taste,
Garbed to the modern taste,
For idleness and sense to waste –
From my words take warning due,
Before the mirror, then would leave
His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,
A poem in cantos, twenty-five!
Of cosseting one who’s half alive;
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
My lips from hers will softly prove
И жить торопится и чувствовать спешит.
With some fair Venetian face,
Though innocent tries one’s patience.
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
To enter on the masquerade.
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
While both indoors and outside
To tell iambic from trochee.
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
Was he as vigorous and carefree
The coachmen by the fire free
(The place where we began, you see)
Where fashion’s loyal devotee
Their dinner-table and their wife.
Tired of the laughter of the age,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
The rustling curtain as we breathe
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
“Why the devil can’t you die?”’
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
While weary servants half-awake,
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
With witticisms forged with guile,
Translated the sublime Corneille,
To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:
Since, I’m one too and just the same.
Touching lightly on each theme,
Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime
Tells him, now is dinner-time.
So unapproachable, serene,
To any but ourselves alone.
Sentimental, free from care,
Yet Tasso’s murmured octaves are
Through the hall, our hero’s there,
They’re never worth the singer’s fire,
Three houses offer a soirée:
There beside the Neva’s shore,
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
Silent, chattering, as you please,
Worn out by the ballroom’s noise
The merchant and the beggar rise,
The useful arts, can devise,
Their absent masters to berate.
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
Then what an epic I’ll contrive,
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
Since, foretelling to my gaze
The French cuisine’s finest proof,
I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing
Silently impart love’s teaching!
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
And, exiled for that very thing
A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
The audience, their feet still tapping,
Orchestra already tiring,
But later found it re-assuring,
Enters. The room is gyring,
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
Friends and friendship were confusing,
Faithlessness was not amusing
He’s off to Talon’s, calculating
Then later, intimacies meeting,
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
How utterly himself forgetting!
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
Falling ill like that, and dying;
Admire it, as if he were trying.
Freedom’s champion, ever strong
In human rights, was here all wrong.
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
Sang the maid on mountain high,
And with southern oceans nigh
Since even he at times would sigh
Silently to yawn and sigh
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
That, search all Russia though,
It’s not my job to work them through.
Free, and in the flower of youth,
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
The country caused the same ennui
Or chondria, when we Russians speak,
He drew a mourning veil of black.
Across the literary stack,
Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,
Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek
The cause of which it’s time to seek,
Blue columns rising over folk,
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
Then off to ramble in the park.
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
He chose – a more than worthy goal,
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
And to delight the sensual
Rushes to live, and makes haste to feel.
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
Onegin and I planned to travel,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel,
You’re curious for every detail,
As some suspicious aged devil,
A birthday party, here a ball.
Better to hurry to the ball,
That Onegin is not me, recall
The pain of time lost, past recall:
Where will my young idler call?
To the magic bow in thrall,
Onegin has outpaced us all.
Cannot but despise it all,
O country life! I like you all,
Mastered I’ve no time to tell,
Today we know, truth to tell
One thing alone he studied well,
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
Tried to write, it makes him ill
No longer even stirred his will,
No, passion took no greater toll,
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
As emptiness possessed his soul,
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
Swims across the drowsy stream,
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
But our Onegin’s off to roam,
With some ready epigram.
Then like a very sage could seem
Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem
Thank God no desire claimed him,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
Taught him everything by whim,
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
He’d wander through a drawing room,
Each falling there as they form
Recall the sea before a storm,
It summons up respect, one can
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
I’ve sketched the underlying plan,
The careful spouse as much his man,
‘My uncle, what a worthy man,
Now our Eugene’s a countryman,
I too cast off the social burden,
Their very presence causes spleen.
Go, little book: find Neva then,
I made a friend of Eugene then.
How I envied the waves then,
Shall I depict with faithful pen
The circle claps to make all happen,
I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
My darkened mind grew clear again,
Music’s magic, thought, and pain.
Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,
He would neglect and then abandon.
Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
Overcome with wit and passion,
Both had known the play of passion
The science of the tender passion
Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,
The dance-floor was my passion:
Beseech, elicit true confession,
From the first, he’d spread confusion,
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
We’ve all acquired some education
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
Hating all this litigation,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
To pass a note of assignation.
Secure a secret assignation,
Love in imagination,
Was once my sole preoccupation.
Insomnia, pale inspiration,
‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,
Though it adds to conversation,
Generally their conversation
Such our young dog’s meditation,
God be thanked, some imitation,
Your pure, pensive incantation?
Finding it small deprivation,
The intellect’s cold observation,
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
And though they’re filled with contradiction,
But there’s a risk in such fiction,
I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,
Catch the first flush of emotion,
The house was filled with commotion,
Had called to show their true devotion,
Like women, books proved a deception,
All chained to their pre-conception,
Though I’m an adept at description,
To journalists for their consumption
Plus another hidden reason,
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
He saw as clear as the dawn,
He even felt the urge to yawn,
Of someone other, never own
The censors must have work to do.
For I stopped sinning long ago.
The milkmaids from Ochta go
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
The hero’s name I’ve given too;
I liked his face, his manner too,
The coolness of the dark glades too,
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
There I too strolled to and fro:
He yawned inordinately, and so
Though the North affects me so.
A host of nymphs around her, so
I dare to write about it so,
I’m ready now for chapter two.
Or frighten with a glance or two
More than once in white night-cap
But Petersburg that restless heap
Has opened up his serving flap.
Benediction we drank deep!
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
Like prisoners released in sleep,
Of lovely woman, freakish fop.
Heads, in profile, edges crop,
But now my friends I often hear,
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Glistening, an obedient tear!
Always gave three balls a year
Your question ringing in my ear,
Friends and enemies from afar
Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.
When will my wings begin to soar?
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
This hostile climate where I wander,
In winter, resting on the fender,
His father had a fine career
And when he wanted to refer
The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
When shall I ever loose my tether?
Here without an ounce of bother,
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
Twists her waist one way, another,
The punctilious German baker,
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
He wakes at noon, or even later,
Satire’s most audacious master,
He had the gift of easy chatter,
He’ll have time still for the latter.
Which to visit first? No matter,
When talk was of some graver matter,
His uncle lay at death’s door, better
In fact he soon received a letter
His life till dawn the same as ever,
But kept the juiciest stories ever
And our Katenin moreover
The safest place for a lover
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,
All life, before us, seemed so fair.
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
Ah, they made me long despair
You’ll not find three lovely pair.
Though young he learnt the way to stir
Where you too were nourished or
‘What do I haunt the ballet for?
Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,
This ruthless critic, legislator,
The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
Or her breast, filled with languor;
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
In days of dream and ardour,
Did I so long with painful ardour
Each man to his own ideas,
How I longed to be those seas
Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
Seeking the pleasure of my friends
Might have been turned to better ends –
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
All is still, only the guards
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Call to each other in the yards,
Sees it all; the fashions, faces,
He notes the boxes, serried places,
Not for long were lovely ladies
That fashion or luxury supplies,
You were the first, capricious belles,
Lines more worthy of such themes,
Such as they are, view these extremes
Land of bewitchment! In past times
And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes.
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
No, never in the fiercest fires
Of tortured youth and its desires
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Would join the literary bores,
Askance his opera-glass now centres
Steel combs, files in various guises,
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Down the streets where evening drowses,
One foot planted, pirouettes
To his stand the cabman drives,
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
Again imagination blazes,
Again, a simple touch amazes,
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;
Were ever dearest friends of his,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
A flow of silhouetted stills,
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
Reflecting you, your noble dreams,
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
They yet can thrill me in my dreams.
While behind the window streams
I still remember, and it seems
The little foot I touch it seems;
While drowned by frantic violins
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
Then he turns away – and yawns,
To kiss the young Armida’s lips,
All in our sage’s cell appears
He with lawyers round his ears,
I’m grieving still, but free of tears,
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
The storm that shook my soul for years
Ozerov’s tragedies for years
A single boat with outspread oars
A distant strand of singing soars;
My pen I find no longer wanders,
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
I’d still wander those bright bowers.
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
I’ve wasted far too many hours,
My disenchanted opera-glass,
In the water’s smooth still glass,
Turning on the alien mass
So youth’s happiness must pass,
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
It’s peppered with them to excess,
Who in your verse is your goddess?
I love their little feet, confess
No Russian terms exist, confess,
A pedant in the details, no less.
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
As it is, I ask forgiveness,
And carpeted voluptuousness.
Rewards with its fond caress
The girls in fashionable dress,
Meanwhile in his morning dress
Was a very dandy in his dress,
Was it for you all that distress?
Pleased as I always am to stress,
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
Beneath the table’s damask gloss,
In the springtime on the moss,
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
The dead man buried priest and guests
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
In silent joy, of night’s bounteous
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
Istomina stands, serious
To roam the forests green, so us,
So inflexible, so virtuous,
Were changing with the passing days.
In the morning of our days.
I once spent my sweetest days?
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
In happiness, in idle ways,
Glad now that his former ways
All mankind’s malicious ways
The ballet’s beat he should be at.
Glass on glass to drench the heat
As his watch’s chimes repeat
And ignominiously repeat
As though we can never treat
Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,
An instant hails the entrechat,
A bit of this a bit of that,
And we can all display éclat,
He breathes the air of freedom, at
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
And gladly lived a life of debt
So blameless in their intellect,
So clever, and so circumspect,
Sketching women’s legs and feet,
Threads the rows among the feet,
Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
Madman, could your heart forget?
And died with all he owed unmet.
Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,
On the granite parapet,
His heart consumed with regret
To his rivals, that whole set,
On what spring flowers are you set?
His virulence, his scorn, alight
His labour, torment and delight,
The child of luxury and delight.
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Indifferent to the world’s delight
Her way again in soulful flight?
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
With that pale diaphanous light,
To read an epigraph, and might
And turning morning into night
How often, on a summer’s night,
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
His springtime occupation bright,
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
He who feels, is quickly taught
He who’s lived, he who’s thought
That I have here daubed my portrait,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
Yet were they wholly innocent
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Alas, on every stray amusement
But was dear Yevgeny content
The pineapple’s pure golden unguent.
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
My country: exile was my lot,
The bitter record of the heart.
How swift his letters from the heart!
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Unripe powers, or fading art,
His glance now bold, with tender art,
Again the pain, again love’s art!
And my Eugene was free at last,
Recalling romance of time past,
Parading there with all the rest,
Did full justice to the rest,
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
By the will of Zeus the Just.
He’d no desire to dig the dust
As his horses plough the dust,
Of history all turned to rust,
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
Pay attention now I beg you,
And far niente is my law.
At that time, and retired from view,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
How skilfully he’d feign the new,
For two days it was all quite new,
Are you as you were? Have new
The solitariness of the meadow,
All serious effort – no words flow,
He knew enough I would allow
Albion’s proud lyre I follow,
Latin’s not in fashion now,
Soaring up the marble stair now,
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Crunching over morning snow.
The twin lights of the carriage throw
Past the doorman like an arrow,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
My services to you I vow!
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
And creditors had him at bay,
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
That occupied each night and day,
That sitting by the bed all day,
From Romulus to our own day,
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
There Didelot too crowned his day,
Say farewell without delay.
Though it’s true some woman may
Three notes appear, on a tray.
Monotonous and varied, say,
From his uncle’s man, to say
In his memory tucked away.
Then his father passed away,
And kept dull boredom far away –
His beaver-collar shines away,
All night, barely a foot away!
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
For all those years long sped by?
To all unfaithful by and by,
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
The light-footed girls sweep by,
The object of his constancy;
Liked his dreamy tendency,
Produced his hive of comedy,
I love youth’s frantic energy,
No reason why a man of energy
Of how it lives, the what and why
Prince Vyazemsky
Roam beneath my African sky,
Treading the boards interminably,
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
Guard your daughters most severely,
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
Leaning, musing pensively,
Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly
As ardent glances swiftly fly
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
With staple products its supply,
In order to be heard more clearly.
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
Or else, reviewing distantly,
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
To dream affection constantly
Though I’ve consulted frequently
Love’s madness, wild and unruly,
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
I was bitter, he was gloomy.
But as for genius, if any,
Onegin, he was deemed by many
(Critics stern, acute as any)
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
I suffered without hope or joy.
Happy is he who can employ
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
The Academic Dictionary.
That dressing room, all solitary,
Await the touch, involuntary,
‘Clear the road!’ loud sings the cry,
Listen for the heart’s first cry,
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
My soul preserved its memory
Of your sublime clear poetry.
To give his life for poetry,
Of over-elaborate slander try
Pampered in eastern luxury
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
Exhausted by society,
Ingenuous naivety,
Your spirit’s true simplicity
His unique eccentricity,
His uncle’s frail mortality.
The Muse gave it eternity,
So he’ll double the intensity
Pleased that they had done their duty.
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
